# Project Euler #4: Largest palindrome product
[Solution](https://github.com/zhaohanson1/project_euler_plus/blob/master/4%20-%20Largest%palindrome%product/solution.md)

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is **101101 = 143 x 707**.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than **N**.

**Input Format**

First line contains **T** , the number of test cases. This is followed by **T** lines each containing an integer **N**.

**Constraints**
- 1 &le; T &le; 100
- 101101; N &le; 1000000

**Output Format**

Print the required answer for each test case in a new line.

**Sample Input 0**
```
2
101110
800000
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
101101
793397
```

**Explanation 0**
- **101101** is the product of **143** and **707**.
- **793397** is the product of **869** and **913**.
