The solution to this problem is exactly the same as [Problem 18](https://github.com/zhaohanson1/project_euler_plus/blob/master/018%20-%20Maximum%20path%20sum%20I/solution.md)

The difference is that the test cases in this problem have larger trees so that bruteforce becomes infeasible, requiring the use of dynamic programming.
