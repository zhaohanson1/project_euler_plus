# Project Euler #12: Highly divisible triangular number

[Solution](https://github.com/zhaohanson1/project_euler_plus/blob/master/012%20-%20Highly%20divisible%20triangular%20number/solution.md)

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the **7th** triangle number would be   
**1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28**. The first ten terms would be:  
**1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...**

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:


**1 : 1  
3 : 1, 3  
6 : 1, 2, 3, 6  
10 : 1, 2, 5, 10  
15 : 1, 3, 5, 15  
21 : 1, 3, 7, 21  
28 : 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28**

We can see that **28** is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over **N** divisors?
