# Project Euler #10: Summation of primes

The sum of the primes below **10** is **2+3+5+7=17**.

Find the sum of all the primes not greater than given **N** .
#### Input Format

The first line contains an integer **T** i.e. number of test cases.
The next **T** lines will contain an integer **N**.

Constraints
- **1 &le; T &le; 10<sup>4</sup>**
- **1 &le; N &le; 10<sup>6</sup>**

#### Output Format

Print the value corresponding to each test case in separate line.

#### Sample Input 0

```
2
5
10
```

#### Sample Output 0

```
10
17
```

#### Explanation 0

- For **N = 5**, we have primes as **{2, 3, 5}** and the sum is **10**.
- For **N = 10**, we have primes as **{2, 3, 5, 7}** and the sum is **17**.
