# Project Euler #15: Lattice paths

Starting in the top left corner of a **2 x 2**  grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly **6** routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a **N x M** grid? As number of ways can be very large, print it modulo **(10<sup>9</sup> + 7)**.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer **T** , i.e., number of test cases.
Next **T**  lines will contain integers **N** and **M**.

**Constraints**
* 1 &le; T &le; 10<sup>3</sup>
* 1 &le; N &le; 500
* 1 &le; M &le; 500

**Output Format**

Print the values corresponding to each test case.

**Sample Input**
```
2
2 2
3 2
```

**Sample Output**
```
6
10
```

**Explanation**

For **2 x 2** as shown in statement above.
