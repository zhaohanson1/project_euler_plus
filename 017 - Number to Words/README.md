The numbers **1** to **5** written out in words are 

One, Two, Three, Four, Five

First character of each word will be capital letter for example:
**104382426112* is 

**One Hundred Four Billion Three Hundred Eighty Two Million Four Hundred Twenty Six Thousand One Hundred Twelve**

Given a number, you have to write it in words.

### Input Format

#### Problem 17
[Solution](https://github.com/zhaohanson1/project_euler_plus/blob/master/017%20-%20Number%20to%20Words/solution-classic.md)

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?


NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. 
For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 
23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. 
The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
