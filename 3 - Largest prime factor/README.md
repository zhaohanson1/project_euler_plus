[Solution](https://github.com/zhaohanson1/project_euler_plus/blob/master/3%20-%20Largest%20prime%20factor/solution.md)

The prime factors of **13195** are **5, 7, 13** and **29**.

What is the largest prime factor of a given number **N**?

**Input Format**

First line contains **T** , the number of test cases. This is followed by **T** lines each containing an integer **N**.

**Constraints**
- 1 &le; T &le; 10
- 10 &le; N &le; 10<sup>12<sup>

**Output Format**

For each test case, display the largest prime factor of **N*

**Sample Input 0**
```
2
10
17
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
5
17
```

**Explanation 0**
- Prime factors of **10** are **{2,5}** largest is **5**.
- Prime factor of **17** is **17**  itself, hence largest is **17**.
