# Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

[Solution](https://github.com/zhaohanson1/project_euler_plus/blob/master/2%20-%20Even%20Fibonacci%20numbers/solution.md)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with **1** and **2** , the first **10** terms will be:
**<div align='center'> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... </div>**
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed **N**, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Input Format**
First line contains **N** that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by **T** lines, each containing an integer, **N** .

**Constraints**
- 1 &le; T &le; 10<sup>5<sup>
- 10 &le; N &le; 4 x 10<sup>16<sup>

**Output Format**

Print the required answer for each test case.

**Sample Input 0**
```
2
10
100
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
10
44
```

**Explanation 0**

For **N = 10**, we have **{2, 8}**, sum is **10**.

For **N = 100**, we have **{2, 8, 34}**, sum is **44**.
